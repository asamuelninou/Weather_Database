# Weather_Database
## Overview
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they've recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data.

For this challenge, I will use the weather description data you've already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Geoapify Routing API, you will create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.

## Analysis
### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
For this deliverable, you'll generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data I gathered in this module, use my API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. I created a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data. I created a folder called Weather_Database to save all the files related with this deliverable.

## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
In this deliverable, I'll employ input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences. Next, I'll use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, I'll show those destinations on a map.

## Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
For this deliverable, I'll use the Geoapify Routing API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, I'll create a map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
